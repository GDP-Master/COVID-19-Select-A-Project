# Overview

<!-- img class="overview-image" src=""-->

Since we no longer have access to our computer lab, the work that you are each able to do might look very different than what we were doing at school. Let's use this as an opportunity to work on developing the skills of learning indepentently and of managing a project.

This may feel like quite a change from what you're used to. Don't worry, the goal is to learn something that is interesting to you and to develop some valuable skills along the way.
